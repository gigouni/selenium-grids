# Selenium grids

A POC about the way of manipulate the Selenium grids for several platforms (Edge, Chrome or even Android, iOS, ...)

## What it is?

[The Selenium grids](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/grid/) are tools to automatize tests on several OS and browsers. The grids are the hub of possible targets for the tests.

## The objectives

When you don't know something, your objectives can be related to questions

* How implement the Selenium grids?
* How use Microsft's virtual machines to emulate Microsft's product environment?
* How produce tests on Android emulator through Appium and how use the grid related to it?
* How use the grids with iOS?
* How much resources does it consume?
* How much computes/machines are necessary to run it?

The support should be resolved for

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Microsoft Edge
* Internet Explorer 11
* Android
* iOS
